 <p class="line-break margin-top-10">he reason why I wrote The Future of Cryptocurrencies Blog is to inform people about cryptocurrencies and make some predictions in the light of information about the future, since I am a crypto money investor and NFT Collector.

“The first half of 2022 has been very bad for the crypto market. Bitcoin and ethereum are down more than 50% from their all-time highs at the end of 2021. While there have been minor fluctuations in recent weeks, the crypto market as a whole has largely stalled. Although no one knows for sure, some experts say that crypto prices may fall further before any sustainable recovery.” I would like to say that this decline has reached the crypto market saturation and therefore the crypto market has been operated through investors (Whales).</p>
 <p class="margin-top-10">The USA will make a series of reforms that will regulate the cryptocurrency market due to these economic operations. “Bitcoin hit all-time highs in 2021 - followed by massive dips - and more institutional buyouts from big companies. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, also recorded an all-time high late last year, and then in June 2021 It fell below $900, its lowest level since the inception of the United States. U.S. government officials and the Biden administration have increasingly expressed their interest in new regulations for cryptocurrency."</p>
  <p class="margin-top-10">Investments in cryptocurrencies continue, but cryptocurrencies are used as money laundering. Bitcoin researchers have discovered a dark web that criminals use to launder money with digital currencies. combats money laundering. There are not only money laundering but also crypto money stealing, but cryptocurrencies are still perceived as safe.

People's interest in crypto is still high: Thanks to long-standing investors like Elon Musk, trust is subject to the dominant system. Elon Musk is operating in crypto. Bitcoin invests, Tesla sells vehicles in Bitcoin, but in his last speech, he says that Bitcoin harms the environment, what is so strange. but he himself buys and saves Bitcoin. Events like this cause us to change the way we look at Crypto. But for a long time, Cryptocurrencies seem to continue their lives as promising wealth.</p>
