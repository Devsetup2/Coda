    <p class="line-break margin-top-10">s it possible to establish a colony in space? I think it is possible with the rapid development of technology, I even thought about establishing a colony in space for you. According to World Famous Businessman Elon Musk: Many concerns such as global warming, depleting energy resources, and, in Musk's words, the 3rd world war are among the reasons for the dream of establishing a colony in space.The resources that are hoped to be found on Mars also reinforce this dream. The dream of establishing a colony, which seems quite controversial, brings with it many questions, especially where it would be appropriate to establish the colony. The idea of ​​establishing a colony in space dates back to 1969 when human beings set foot on the Moon. In other words, it is not the new idea of mankind, but the idea of establishing a colony on another planet in space. As far as we all know, the dream of establishing the first colony seems to start on the planet Mars, but the actual initial testing process will be made on the Moon, according to new information. The difference of the world in space is that it allows human life, but is space suitable for life? </p>
    <p class="margin-top-10"> We all know that many factors such as gravity, food, water, oxygen are not suitable. So what are we doing? Last year, a gravitational environment was created in China, just for colony activities, Nasa chose plants to grow in space and conducted tests. India's acceleration of space studies also shows the importance of space colony activities. why did you ever think about this race? This is the first reason why the world is becoming uninhabitable, but the main reason is to dominate fertile places in space or to dominate in space.
