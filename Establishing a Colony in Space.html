    <p class="line-break margin-top-10">have always wondered if it is possible to establish a colony in space, so I researched to the smallest detail, followed the agenda and I think it is possible with the rapid development of technology.
According to World Famous Businessman Elon Musk: Many concerns such as global warming, depletion of energy resources and, in Musk's words, the 3rd world war are among the reasons for the dream of establishing a colony in space. </p>
      <p class="line-break margin-top-10">These reasons have increased the interest in Mars.
 In other words, it's not humanity's new idea, but the idea of ​​colonizing another planet in space. As we all know, the dream of establishing the first colony seems to begin on the planet Mars, but according to new information, the real first test process will be held on the Moon. Earth's difference in space is that it allows human life, but is space suitable for life?
</p>
      <p class="line-break margin-top-10">We all know that many factors such as gravity, food, water, oxygen are not suitable. So what are we doing? Last year, a gravity-only environment was created in China for colonial activities, Nasa selected and tested plants for growing in space. India's acceleration of space studies also shows the importance of space colony activities. Why did you ever think about this race?
Wars, extinction of nature and animals, biological destructions, epidemics, the possibility of depletion of mines, and the survival adventure of a group of rich people, of course, we do research for humanity.</p>
      <p class="line-break margin-top-10">The purpose of space studies is the first reason. Money is clearly very valuable metals in space, very soon robots will extract these mines in space, space cargo companies will bring them to the world. You don't need to be a prophet to know that, everything is clear, but if you ask me, nothing will change even if Mankind goes to space, it will be like the world. unfortunately in space.</p>
      <p class="line-break margin-top-10">This is the first reason why the world has become uninhabitable, but the main reason seems to be the struggle to dominate the places where the mines are rich in space or to find a place in space. I am Muammer Altunkan Thank you for reading my blog post.</p>
