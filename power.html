 <p class="line-break margin-top-10">oda Blog presents; Who rules the world? I've always wondered, I was looking for the answer to this question, then I said to myself, research and present it for everyone to learn.</p>
 <p class="margin-top-10">First of all, it is necessary to make a distinction in order to learn the answer to this question. <b>Politics (Politics)-Finance(companies)</b>If you are not in these two groups, you are on the managed side.You must have heard the word "New World Order".</p>
 <p class="margin-top-10">Have you heard of <b>John D. Rockefeller? </b>There are families that rule the world, <b>not the complete theory, but the truth.</b>In the order we call this family, they first develop in the field of finance, buy politicians and manage countries, and even have a say in the world market. They have made great fortunes by making perceptions in the country's stock exchanges. I hear you say there is justice. There is no justice in the world.</p>
 <p class="margin-top-10">John D. Rockefeller, whom I mentioned earlier, is one of these families. Another family, the <b>Morgan Family</b>, determines the political course of the USA and controls all the banks in the world. John Pierpont Morgan, the first known of the Morgan lineage, started the first financial empire in the United States, selling weapons during the civil war and almost being prosecuted for it.Today, the Morgan family is still one of the most influential families in banking.</p>
  <p class="margin-top-10"><b>House of Saud</b> The Saud Dynasty, the royal family that has ruled Saudi Arabia since 1932, is<b>King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud</b> and the number of family members in this dynasty is around 25,000. The leader of the family holds absolute political power, and family members hold important official, government, and military positions. The family also controls about 20% of global oil reserves.</p>
 <p class="margin-top-10"><b>Rothschild Family</b>The Rothschild family was among the wealthiest families in the world during the Napoleonic era. There are many different theories and rumors about the family. Some say they control all the money and all the financial institutions in the world.
Rothschild's fortune is estimated at $2 trillion.</p>
 <p class="margin-top-10"><b>Baruch Family</b>The Baruch family is thought to have less money than the Rothschilds and Rockefellers. But they are definitely greater in power and control.</p>
  <p class="margin-top-10"><b>The Walton Family</b> Sam Walton opened his first Walmart store in 1962. This made him one of the richest people in the world at that time. After Sam Walton's death, the company was taken over by his wife and 4 children. Apart from supermarkets, the family owns and also owns Arvest Bank.</p>
  <p class="margin-top-10"><b>House of Windsor</b>House of Windsor is the royal family of Great Britain. Currently, at the head of the Windsor family, III. There is Charles. The king is also head of the church and commander-in-chief of Great Britain's military forces.
He is the ruler of 15 independent countries besides Great Britain.</p>
  <p class="margin-top-10"><b>Murdoch Family</b> The Murdochs began to build their empire in Australia. Keith Murdoch was a political journalist for one of the newspapers in Melbourne and later became CEO, increasing the sales of the newspaper.
Today, the Murdochs own 20th Century Fox, Fox News, Myspace and Dow Jones.</p>
